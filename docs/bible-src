In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.
God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." There was evening and there was morning, one day.
God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
God called the expanse "sky." There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.
God called the dry land "earth," and the gathering together of the waters he called "seas." God saw that it was good.
God said, "Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth"; and it was so.
The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth"; and it was so.
God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.
