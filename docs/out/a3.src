Why The Times Published Details of the Whistle-Blower's Identity
On Thursday, The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the whistle-blower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week. (The article reported that the whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine.)
Many readers, including some who work in national security and intelligence, have criticized The Times's decision to publish the details, saying it potentially put the person's life in danger and may have a chilling effect on would-be whistle-blowers.
We took their concerns to Dean Baquet, The Times's executive editor, who responded to them in a discussion with the Reader Center:
The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding. The president himself has called the whistle-blower's account a "political hack job."
We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower - including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.

INTRODUCTION
The developing union of people of Europe is the driving force behind the cross-border cooperation as a part of broader territorial cooperation that has been with us for more than 20 years by now.
Let it provide itself the introduction into this joint report of supreme audit institutions of two close countries:
“185 million EU citizens, or 37% of the population, live in border areas.
These are often peripheral, underdeveloped or marginalised areas- sometimes the borders are historical scars.
The main aim of cross-border cooperation is to reduce the effect of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, tackle common problems and exploit untapped potential.
The programmes cover a variety of border regions: some work with maritime areas, others with internal EU land borders or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most programmes are bilateral, but some consist of more than two neighbouring countries (e.g. South Baltic programme).
The programmes last for seven years. It should be noted that there is EUR 5.7 billion in total earmarked for all programmes in this period.
“The programme activities include: Repairing and (re)building cross-border roads, cycle paths or bridges; Investing in cross-border waste systems, medical equipment, research centres, anti-flood measures, and so on; Managing jointly natural or tourism sites; Developing common services for the local population; Advising on employment issues; and Creating thematic networks and clusters for innovation.
The funding is granted on condition that organisations from both sides of the border, such as regional authorities, universities and small and medium enterprises, come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.
Representatives of cooperating regions, thematic ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects are going to be supported.
This unique structure is supposed to lead to sustainable collaboration that continues long after the programme ends.
The funding is granted on condition that partners from both sides of the border work together and fulfil at least two of the following conditions: common financing, common staffing, common preparation and common implementation of the project.”
Within the partnership framework, the tasks and responsibility for preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed among the respective partners.
The following are main attributes: joint selection of leading partner; joint preparation of project and applications; making of joint agreement of partnership signed by all partners; overtaking of complete responsibility for project implementation by leading partner; total support payments received by leading partner who completes their transfer to respective project partners.
The support can be granted to eligible projects implemented in the regions and voivodeships adjacent to the joint border.

RECOMMENDATIONS
A common recommendation of the NKU and the NIK concerns an improvement of the monitoring system specifically by consistent assignation of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of priority axis of the Operational Programme.
Generally, it is also necessary to aim for designing monitoring indicators both on the programme and project level which would enable more operative verification of the achievement of set effects.
Remarks and recommendations resulting from the audits carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate audit reports of NKU and NIK on CD.
COMMUNIQUÉ
The report has been drawn up in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the Presidents of supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and Poland.

Black hole swallowing and ripping apart star captured for first time
A gigantic black hole has been captured pulling in and ripping apart a star for the first time.
The star, which was about the same size as our sun, was seen from 375 million light years away warping and spiralling into the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, researchers said in the Astrophysical Journal.
It was then sucked into oblivion in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event.
NASA's planet-searching telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite - TESS - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time.
Astronomers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at TESS, whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets, caught the beginning of the violent event.
Thomas Holoien, an astronomer for the Carnegie Institution for Science who led the research, said: "This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward."
Stars get sucked in when they venture too close to a supermassive black hole, which lives at the centre of most galaxies, including the Earth's Milky Way.
The black hole's impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart, with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole, forming a disc of hot, bright gas as it is swallowed.
Mr Holoien added: "Specifically, we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brightening, and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique."

China Says It Didn't Fight Any War Nor Invaded Foreign Land
China on Friday said it has not provoked a "single war or conflict" or "invaded a single square" of foreign land, skirting any reference to the 1962 war with India.
"China has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation," stated an official white paper released, four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on October 1.
"China safeguards world peace through real actions. Over the past 70 years, China has not provoked a single war or conflict, nor invaded a single square of foreign land," the paper titled "China and the World in the New Era" said.
The white paper, while highlighting the CPS's "peaceful rise" made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with India and the vast tracts of land, especially in the Aksai Chin area, occupied by China.
The Sino-India border dispute involving 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) remained unresolved. China also claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which India contests.
So far, the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute.
Besides the 1962 war, India and China had a major military standoff at Doklam in 2017 when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tried to lay a road close to India"s narrow Chicken Neck corridor connecting with the North-Eastern states in an area also claimed by Bhutan.
It was finally diplomatically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops.
China also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979. China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.
"China has achieved full resolution of land border delimitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries, and delineated the China-Vietnam maritime boundary in the Beibu Gulf," the white paper said, noting that since reform and opening up in 1978, the country has cut its armed forces "by over four million."
The two-million strong Chinese military still remain the world's largest.

This year's Turner Prize-shortlisted pieces will be on display in Margate from tomorrow, with Brexit on the agenda.
Colombian artist Oscar Murillo's work "surge (social cataracts) " depicts people staring out to the North Sea, but with their view of the water and the European continent on the other side of it obscured by a dark canvas, with only a sliver of what lies beyond revealed through a slash in the canvas.
The work is one of four shortlisted entries to the prestigious and often contentious annual art prize, founded in 1984 and given to an artist residing in Britain or British-born but living elsewhere.
Curator Fiona Parry explains that Murillo's work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in the UK. The group of papier-mâché figures represent a globalised workforce, while the black cloth represents the "darkness of the contemporary moment in the UK and globally."
She added: "I think it's a broader idea of blocking the view, the outward-looking view, to anywhere really. And that gesture of blocking the light. But I guess there is still this sort of glimmer of hope, there is a slash in the canvas, and you can just see the sea on the horizon."
Helen Cammock's video piece A Long Note, meanwhile, examines the overlooked role of women in the civil rights movement in Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland that began in 1968. The work also connects to broader global class, race and gender struggles during the late 1960s.
All works will be exhibited at Margate's Turner Contemporary gallery, from 28 September to 12 January 2020, and the winner of the Turner Prize 2019 will be announced at a ceremony on 3 December.
Named after 19th-century landscape painter JMW Turner, the award made stars of Grayson Perry, Damien Hirst and 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen.
