<seg id="1">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="2">The developing union of people of Europe is the driving force behind the cross-border cooperation as a part of broader territorial cooperation that has been with us for more than 20 years by now.</seg>
<seg id="3">Let it provide itself the introduction into this joint report of supreme audit institutions of two close countries:</seg>
<seg id="4">“185 million EU citizens, or 37% of the population, live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="5">These are often peripheral, underdeveloped or marginalised areas- sometimes the borders are historical scars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main aim of cross-border cooperation is to reduce the effect of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, tackle common problems and exploit untapped potential.</seg>
<seg id="7">The programmes cover a variety of border regions: some work with maritime areas, others with internal EU land borders or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most programmes are bilateral, but some consist of more than two neighbouring countries (e.g. South Baltic programme).</seg>
<seg id="9">The programmes last for seven years. It should be noted that there is EUR 5.7 billion in total earmarked for all programmes in this period.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The programme activities include: Repairing and (re)building cross-border roads, cycle paths or bridges; Investing in cross-border waste systems, medical equipment, research centres, anti-flood measures, and so on; Managing jointly natural or tourism sites; Developing common services for the local population; Advising on employment issues; and Creating thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The funding is granted on condition that organisations from both sides of the border, such as regional authorities, universities and small and medium enterprises, come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="12">Representatives of cooperating regions, thematic ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects are going to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="13">This unique structure is supposed to lead to sustainable collaboration that continues long after the programme ends.</seg>
<seg id="14">The funding is granted on condition that partners from both sides of the border work together and fulfil at least two of the following conditions: common financing, common staffing, common preparation and common implementation of the project.”</seg>
<seg id="15">Within the partnership framework, the tasks and responsibility for preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed among the respective partners.</seg>
<seg id="16">The following are main attributes: joint selection of leading partner; joint preparation of project and applications; making of joint agreement of partnership signed by all partners; overtaking of complete responsibility for project implementation by leading partner; total support payments received by leading partner who completes their transfer to respective project partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The support can be granted to eligible projects implemented in the regions and voivodeships adjacent to the joint border.</seg>

<seg id="1">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="2">A common recommendation of the NKU and the NIK concerns an improvement of the monitoring system specifically by consistent assignation of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of priority axis of the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="3">Generally, it is also necessary to aim for designing monitoring indicators both on the programme and project level which would enable more operative verification of the achievement of set effects.</seg>
<seg id="4">Remarks and recommendations resulting from the audits carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate audit reports of NKU and NIK on CD.</seg>
<seg id="5">COMMUNIQUÉ</seg>
<seg id="6">The report has been drawn up in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the Presidents of supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and Poland.</seg>

<doc sysid="ref" docid="bible" origlang="en">
<seg id="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</seg>
<seg id="2">Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.</seg>
<seg id="3">God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</seg>
<seg id="4">God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="5">God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." There was evening and there was morning, one day.</seg>
<seg id="6">God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."</seg>
<seg id="7">God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.</seg>
<seg id="8">God called the expanse "sky." There was evening and there was morning, a second day.</seg>
<seg id="9">God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.</seg>
<seg id="10">God called the dry land "earth," and the gathering together of the waters he called "seas." God saw that it was good.</seg>
<seg id="11">God said, "Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth"; and it was so.</seg>
<seg id="12">The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.</seg>
<seg id="13">There was evening and there was morning, a third day.</seg>
<seg id="14">God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</seg>
<seg id="15">and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth"; and it was so.</seg>
<seg id="16">God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</seg>

<seg id="1">China Says It Didn't Fight Any War Nor Invaded Foreign Land</seg>
<seg id="2">China on Friday said it has not provoked a "single war or conflict" or "invaded a single square" of foreign land, skirting any reference to the 1962 war with India.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation," stated an official white paper released, four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on October 1.</seg>
<seg id="4">"China safeguards world peace through real actions. Over the past 70 years, China has not provoked a single war or conflict, nor invaded a single square of foreign land," the paper titled "China and the World in the New Era" said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The white paper, while highlighting the CPS's "peaceful rise" made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with India and the vast tracts of land, especially in the Aksai Chin area, occupied by China.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Sino-India border dispute involving 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) remained unresolved. China also claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which India contests.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute.</seg>
<seg id="8">Besides the 1962 war, India and China had a major military standoff at Doklam in 2017 when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tried to lay a road close to India"s narrow Chicken Neck corridor connecting with the North-Eastern states in an area also claimed by Bhutan.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was finally diplomatically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops.</seg>
<seg id="10">China also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979. China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.</seg>
<seg id="11">"China has achieved full resolution of land border delimitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries, and delineated the China-Vietnam maritime boundary in the Beibu Gulf," the white paper said, noting that since reform and opening up in 1978, the country has cut its armed forces "by over four million."</seg>
<seg id="12">The two-million strong Chinese military still remain the world's largest.</seg>

<seg id="1">'How dare you?' Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="3">A participant holds a drawing depicting Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg during a protest march to call for action against climate change, in The Hague, Netherlands September 27, 2019. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw</seg>
<seg id="4">Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000. Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.</seg>
<seg id="7">Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."</seg>
<seg id="8">"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests. "We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems. But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs."</seg>
<seg id="9">Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id="12">The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.</seg>

<seg id="1">Black hole swallowing and ripping apart star captured for first time</seg>
<seg id="2">A gigantic black hole has been captured pulling in and ripping apart a star for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The star, which was about the same size as our sun, was seen from 375 million light years away warping and spiralling into the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, researchers said in the Astrophysical Journal.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was then sucked into oblivion in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event.</seg>
<seg id="5">NASA's planet-searching telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite - TESS - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Astronomers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at TESS, whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets, caught the beginning of the violent event.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thomas Holoien, an astronomer for the Carnegie Institution for Science who led the research, said: "This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward."</seg>
<seg id="8">Stars get sucked in when they venture too close to a supermassive black hole, which lives at the centre of most galaxies, including the Earth's Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="9">The black hole's impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart, with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole, forming a disc of hot, bright gas as it is swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Holoien added: "Specifically, we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brightening, and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique."</seg>

<seg id="1">Prolonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India</seg>
<seg id="2">India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal. If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.</seg>
<seg id="6">Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall. Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.</seg>
<seg id="7">The monsoon was also late to arrive. Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.</seg>
<seg id="8">The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers. "This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year. It is making my vegetables - I've got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.</seg>
<seg id="9">For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food. Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).</seg>
<seg id="10">Festivals are also at risk. The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.</seg>
<seg id="11">Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil. But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.</seg>

<seg id="1">This year's Turner Prize-shortlisted pieces will be on display in Margate from tomorrow, with Brexit on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2">Colombian artist Oscar Murillo's work "surge (social cataracts) " depicts people staring out to the North Sea, but with their view of the water and the European continent on the other side of it obscured by a dark canvas, with only a sliver of what lies beyond revealed through a slash in the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="3">The work is one of four shortlisted entries to the prestigious and often contentious annual art prize, founded in 1984 and given to an artist residing in Britain or British-born but living elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">Curator Fiona Parry explains that Murillo's work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in the UK. The group of papier-mâché figures represent a globalised workforce, while the black cloth represents the "darkness of the contemporary moment in the UK and globally."</seg>
<seg id="5">She added: "I think it's a broader idea of blocking the view, the outward-looking view, to anywhere really. And that gesture of blocking the light. But I guess there is still this sort of glimmer of hope, there is a slash in the canvas, and you can just see the sea on the horizon."</seg>
<seg id="6">Helen Cammock's video piece A Long Note, meanwhile, examines the overlooked role of women in the civil rights movement in Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland that began in 1968. The work also connects to broader global class, race and gender struggles during the late 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="7">All works will be exhibited at Margate's Turner Contemporary gallery, from 28 September to 12 January 2020, and the winner of the Turner Prize 2019 will be announced at a ceremony on 3 December.</seg>
<seg id="8">Named after 19th-century landscape painter JMW Turner, the award made stars of Grayson Perry, Damien Hirst and 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen.</seg>

<seg id="1">US deaths could result in Scottish ban on vaping and e-cigarette ads</seg>
<seg id="2">A BAN on advertising for e-cigarettes and vaping products, is being considered by ministers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The First Minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in "the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nicola Sturgeon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her Government would "not hesitate" to act.</seg>
<seg id="5">It comes as it emerged a vaping-related illness had claimed two more lives, bringing the total number of fatalities to 11.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vaping - which involves inhaling a mix typically made of nicotine, water, solvents and flavours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit, but its safety is still not entirely known.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the US, more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e-cigarettes. Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday. Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness, with lives lost in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="9">While most patients have reported a history of using products containing THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only "heavy nicotine vaping."</seg>
<seg id="10">The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness, and has warned citizens against smoking e-cigarette products until more is known, particularly if modified or bought "off the street."</seg>
<seg id="11">The First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monitorigin developments in the US and elsewhere "closely," following the loss of life that has been attributed to vaping.</seg>
<seg id="12">She pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vaping being reported in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Our approach has been a precautionary one, which is why in Scotland we have already taken the strictest regulatory approach in Europe to vapour products," she said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The European tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-liquids.</seg>
<seg id="16">"In Scotland, we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In the coming months, we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vapour products."</seg>
<seg id="18">She added: "It is important to stress, and for all of us to remember, that those devices are relatively new and, therefore, their impact continues to be studied. We do not yet fully understand what that impact is, which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious.</seg>
<seg id="19">"That is perhaps a reason why e-cigarette use remains relatively low in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm.</seg>
<seg id="21">"While we already have among the strictest regimes on those products, if the evidence shows that further action is needed... we will not hesitate to take it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why The Times Published Details of the Whistle-Blower's Identity</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the whistle-blower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week. (The article reported that the whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine.)</seg>
<seg id="3">Many readers, including some who work in national security and intelligence, have criticized The Times's decision to publish the details, saying it potentially put the person's life in danger and may have a chilling effect on would-be whistle-blowers.</seg>
<seg id="4">We took their concerns to Dean Baquet, The Times's executive editor, who responded to them in a discussion with the Reader Center:</seg>
<seg id="5">The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding. The president himself has called the whistle-blower's account a "political hack job."</seg>
<seg id="6">We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower - including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.</seg>
